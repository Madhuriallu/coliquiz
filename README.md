Adding question to your quiz

Adding multiple questions to your quiz:

Adding random questions from a category:

A random question places a link that selects a unique question at random from a specific question category. Random questions are selected when the quiz is generated for a specific learner attempt.

This means that different learners are likely to get a different selection of questions when they attempt this quiz. For example, when a quiz has 10 random questions that draw on a question category with 30 questions. If a quiz allows multiple attempts for each student then each attempt will also contain a new selection of questions.

The grade for the randomly chosen question will be rescaled so that the maximum grade is what you have chosen as the grade for the random question.


Question Types

Calculated

Calculated questions offer a way to create individual numerical questions by the use of wildcards (i.e {x} , {y}) that are substituted with random values when the quiz is taken.

For example, if you want to create a large number of "Calculate the area of a rectangle" problems to drill your students, you could create a question with two wildcards (i.e. {base}, {height}) and put in the "Correct Answer Formula=" input field {base} * {height} ( * being the multiplication sign ).
